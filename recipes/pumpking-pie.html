    </p>
    <h2>Igredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix: Well, technically you'll first need to preheat the oven. Then you
        can start by mixing all the ingredients for your filling: pumpkin puree,
        sweetened condensed milk, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt.
        Whisk it all together until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Pour the mixture into your pie crust (store-bought or homemade is
        fine). Bake in the preheated oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat and bake some more: Now you'll reduce the heat and continue
        to bake. This helps the pie to cook evenly without cracking. Once a
        knife inserted 1 inch from the crust comes out clean, then it's ready.
        The center should be just a little jiggly. Let cool and serve,
        refrigerate, or freeze. Really, that's it!
